# Enchanted-Dream
A datapack I'm developping, which adds a ton of magic to the game

Currently in Alpha 1.0, with new spells, mechanics and staffs


To use it, download the "Enchanted Dream" folder, and put it in your world's datapack folder : once you load your world, type "function enchanted_dream:init" and that'll be it ! To use the datapack to it's fullest, install the resourcepack (Enchanted_Dream_Textures.zip) and load it from the resourcepack menu, and you'll have the texture & 3D models I carefully made for this datapack :D

If you wish to become an Alpha-Tester of the datapack, please feel free to contact me, I'll be the judge of wether or not to let you in.

If you encounter any issues while playing with the datapack, feel free to tell me through GitHub, and I'll try to fix them (although don't expect it to be instantaneous, life's been pretty tough these days, and that's a fucking euphemism and a half). I plan on adding more things to the datapack as time goes on, like a ton of new spells, runes, mechanics and extra bells and whistles.



I accept donations in coffee, money, or pretty knives ^o^


Here is a table describing all recipes that are made using either an anvil or a smithing table (depending on the recipe)

here are the things I plan on adding (separated in categories) - These will come at their own pace, because *some* of them I know will be an absolute pain in the backside to make work. This list is ***extremely*** prone to change.

Also, try to fuck me over this repo and I'll come after you with full intent to chew all of your family photos up.







By using this datapack you agree to surrender your soul and all your physical and intellectual properties if asked for it by me, alongside the blood of your firstborn obtained under a red moon, and not to forget, you surrender your free will to me. Thank you ^.^
