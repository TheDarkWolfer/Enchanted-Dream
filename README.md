# Enchanted-Dream
A datapack I'm developping, which adds a ton of magic to the game

Currently in Alpha 1.0, with new spells, mechanics and staffs


To use it, download the "Enchanted Dream" folder, and put it in your world's datapack folder : once you load your world, type "function enchanted_dream:init" and that'll be it ! To use the datapack to it's fullest, install the resourcepack (Enchanted_Dream_Textures.zip) and load it from the resourcepack menu, and you'll have the texture & 3D models I carefully made for this datapack :D



I accept donations in coffee, money, or pretty knives ^o^

By using this datapack you agree to surrender your soul and all your physical and intellectual properties if asked for it by me, alongside the blood of your firstborn obtained under a red moon, and not to forget, you surrender your free will to me. Thank you ^.^
